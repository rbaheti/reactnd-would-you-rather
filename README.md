In this "Would You Rather?" game, users are asked questions in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Users' answers are recorded and a leaderboard is generated based on numbers of questions answered. After a user logs in, he/she is shown all the answered and unasnwered questions.
